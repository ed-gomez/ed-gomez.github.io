Hello, my name is Edwin and I am a software engineer (frontend dev) and science nerd/enthusiast. I have worked as a software engineer since 2017. I am originally from New Orleans, LA (ya heard). This site is where I will post things that interest me and its mostly so I can come back and reference for later.
